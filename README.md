# Helenism Doodles
These are very small doodles of code that I want to preserve for future reference.

#### [Make Things Disappear and Reappear (HTML; CSS; JS(JQuery)](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/make-things-disappear.html)
Using JQuery I created a button that when clicked makes a paragraph of text disappear, then reappear when clicked again.

#### [Fahrenheit to Celsius converter (HTML; JS)](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/fahrenheit-to-celsius.html)
This is a button that when triggered asks you for a temperature in fahrenheit. When this is entered, it is converted to celsius.

#### [Converting Array into List (HTML; JS)](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/array-project.html)
A shopping list was written as an array and then converted into a list using JavaScript.
