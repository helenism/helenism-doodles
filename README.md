These are very small doodles of code that I want to preserve for future reference.


#### [Fahrenheit to Celsius converter (HTML; JS)](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/fahrenheit-to-celsius.html)
This is a button that when triggered asks you for a temperature in fahrenheit. When this is entered, it is converted to celsius.
