#### [Q&A Conversation Program - Python](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/conversation-program.py)

#### [Fahrenheit to Celsius converter - HTML; JavaScript](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles/blob/master/fahrenheit-to-celsius.html)
This is a button that when triggered asks you for a temperature in fahrenheit. When this is entered, it is converted to celsius.
